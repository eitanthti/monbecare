## Key Narrative Principles

### 1. **Credibility First**
Start with WHO/UNICEF standards—not our claims. This establishes MonBe as solving a rigorously defined global health problem.

### 2. **Problem Before Solution**
Never present the solution before fully establishing:
- The global standards (targets)
- The current reality (gap)
- The human/economic cost (urgency)
- WHY this gap exists (the black box)

### 3. **Technical Moat → Data Moat**
Show the hardware innovation, then immediately pivot to the real value: The Milk Graph™ dataset worth $85M-$640M/year.

### 4. **Multiple Risk Reducers**
- BMMPP (consumer-first, no FDA delays)
- Multiple revenue pathways (RPM, ACA, Enterprise)
- Multiple markets ($15.42B TAM)
- Proven team (SolarEdge pedigree)

### 5. **Specificity Builds Confidence**
- Exact WHO targets (60-70% by 2030)
- Exact current rates (25-27% at 6 months)
- Exact costs ($644,500 per hospital/year)
- Exact ROI (15-80x)
- Exact timeline (Year 1: $0.7M-$2.2M → Year 10: $1.5B)

### 6. **End Where You Started**
Hero section mentions $341B crisis → Final CTA reinforces "inevitable" solution to that crisis.

---

## Testing the Story

Ask yourself after each section:
1. **After Problem**: Does the investor believe this is a massive, urgent problem?
2. **After Solution**: Does the investor believe MonBe can solve it uniquely?
3. **After Opportunity**: Does the investor believe this can be a $8-15B company?
4. **After Ask**: Does the investor want to be part of the solution?

If any answer is "no" or "maybe," the story needs strengthening at that point.
